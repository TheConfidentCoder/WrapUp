# WrapUp
An app designed to help you be more mindful in conversation

📱 WrapUp – Be More Mindful in Conversations

Welcome to WrapUp, an iPhone and Apple Watch app designed to help you become more intentional and aware in conversations. Whether you're speaking with friends, family, or colleagues, WrapUp gently supports you in identifying when a conversation may be running long or losing focus—without disrupting the moment.

🧠 Why WrapUp?

Many of us—especially when we're passionate—tend to overtalk or ramble. This can unintentionally dominate conversations, reduce clarity, and lead to listener fatigue. WrapUp is here to help you build conversational mindfulness, just like a fitness tracker helps you build physical awareness.

Offline Listening Support: Core functionality works without WiFi or cellular data.

iCloud Sync (Planned): Seamless syncing across devices.

Saved Sessions: View, copy, share, or delete past conversation transcripts.

Subtle Cues (Planned): Gentle prompts when a conversation needs wrapping up.
